## Custom Configuration

To disable additional instructions, keeping only the table with Danger issues:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
    - name: DangerJS pull request linter
      uses: espressif/shared-github-dangerjs@v1
      with:
        instructions: 'false'
```

When the GitHub repository serves as a public mirror of an internal GitLab project, this setting extends the Review instructions in the collapsible section:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
    - name: DangerJS pull request linter
      uses: espressif/shared-github-dangerjs@v1
      with:
        instructions-gitlab-mirror: 'true'
```

If a Contributions Guide file is specified, a reminder with the link is included in the output:

> üìò Please review the project's [Contributions Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for key guidelines on code ...

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
    - name: DangerJS pull request linter
      uses: espressif/shared-github-dangerjs@v1
      with:
        instructions-contributions-file: 'CONTRIBUTING.md'
```

If a Contributor License Agreement link is specified, a reminder with the link is included in the output:

> üñäÔ∏è Please also make sure you have **read and signed** the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/espressif/project1) for this project.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
